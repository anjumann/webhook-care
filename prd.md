# Webhook Catcher - Product Requirements Document

## Product Overview
Webhook Catcher is a developer tool that provides temporary webhook endpoints for testing and development purposes. It allows developers to inspect incoming webhook payloads, customize responses, and forward requests to local environments, streamlining the integration and debugging process.

## Site Structure & User Flow

### Core Pages
1. **Landing Page (`/`)** 
   - Introduction to the product and its features
   - Clear CTA: "Get Started" (generates ULID and redirects to dashboard)
   - No sign-up required to start using the service
   - Secondary links: Documentation, Pricing, About

2. **Dashboard (`/{{ulid}}`)** 
   - ULID stored in localStorage
   - If ULID exists, auto-redirect to dashboard
   - If not, generate new ULID, store it, and redirect to dashboard
   - Shows list of all created endpoints with key metrics
   - Button to create new endpoint
   - Option to bookmark this page (emphasize it as their unique dashboard)

3. **Endpoint Details (`/{{ulid}}/{{endpoint_name}}`)** 
   - Complete details about a specific endpoint
   - Request logs with expandable details
   - Configuration options
   - Detailed statistics

### User Journey

1. User lands on homepage â†’ clicks "Get Started"
2. System generates ULID, stores in localStorage, redirects to dashboard
3. Dashboard shows empty state with prominent "Create First Endpoint" button
4. User clicks button, enters endpoint name (or uses suggested random name)
5. System creates endpoint and shows success with copyable URL
6. User copies URL to test with their webhook provider
7. As requests come in, they appear in real-time on the dashboard
8. User can click on any request to see details, or on endpoint name to access settings
